# Moving your GitHub repos from "Microsoft" organization to "Microsoft docs" organization
We are moving all our GitHub repos out of the Microsoft organization. Some of the repos will be moved to VSTS or to an organization in GitHub according to your organization guidelines.

Our goal is to have as many OPS repos in Microsoft docs organization as possible.  

* See [Microsoft docs guidelines](microsoft-docs-guidelines.md) for Microsoft docs organization guidelines.
* See [Moving to Microsoft docs tick-tock plan](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/Visual_Studio_China/_layouts/OneNote.aspx?id=%2Fteams%2FVisual_Studio_China%2FShared%20Documents%2FOpen%20Publishing&wd=target%28Features.one%7CA1366F0F-4F98-40ED-98C0-4EA3A6176A95%2FPlan%20to%20migrate%20to%20%22Microsoft%20Docs%22%20organization%7C8CEB8659-6ECE-45A2-93C6-A6CDCBDE84E1%2F%29) to see all the steps you need to take to move to this organization. 

This article only contains details on some of the steps listed in the tick-tock plan. 


## Details on some of the steps for moving from GitHub Microsoft org to Microsoft docs org

### Join the Microsoft docs organization
See [How to Join a Microsoft GitHub Organization](https://www.1eswiki.com/wiki/How_to_Join_the_Microsoft_GitHub_Organization).

### Be an admin collaborator in your repo
As per GitHub documentation, only collaborator permission will be kept when transferring a repo from one organization to the next. Team permissions will be lost.  That means if you are collaborator of the Microsoft repository with admin permission, after transferring, you’re still the admin. However, if you are a member of the team A, even if A has admin permission of the repository, after transferring, you won’t have admin permission any more to the repo in Microsoft docs org. 

So make sure that you are a collaborator with amin permissions on your existing repositories before transferring.

1. Find your repo in [GitHub](https://github.com/).
2. Click on the **Settings** tab.
3. Click on **Collaborators & teams** on the left.
4. Make sure your GitHub user account is in the **Collaborators** area as an admin.

### Transfer ownership of the repo to Microsoft docs organization
You will do this in the OPS portal. Steps will be added here once we have them.
