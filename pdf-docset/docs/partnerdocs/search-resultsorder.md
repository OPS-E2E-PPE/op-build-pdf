Following is the current algorithm to weigh the search results:
1.	If Title contains the search phrase, the weightage points given is 10.
2.	If description contains the search phrase, the weightage given is 5.
3.	If the topic is available in the preferred language, the weightage given is 10x. 
4.	The weightage points are added and then multiplied by the preferred language. For.eg. if the title and description contains the search phrase and the topic is available in the preferred language, the weightage give is (10+5)x10=150
