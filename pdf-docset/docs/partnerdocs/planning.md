# Planning to ship content in OPS
Before creating a project in OPS or moving an existing project to OPS, content owners gather information and make decisions that will impact various points of the conversion and migration effort. This phase is meant to ensure the right questions are asked, the correct people are looped in and the effort is tracked.  

1. Determine the scope of the content that will move to OPS and the stakeholders.
    * If your content is localized, make sure you involve your localization team from the beginning.
2. Follow the steps with your stakeholders listed in the [tick-tock plan](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/STBCSI/e/CE/_layouts/OneNote.aspx?id=%2Fteams%2FSTBCSI%2Fe%2FCE%2FCSI%20REL%2FCSI%20Release%20Tick%20Tock&wd=target%28Tick-Tock%20Overview.one%7CCCAFE2C7-977A-4663-8611-342DBB04A631%2FTick-Tock%20Checklist%20%28Template%5C%29%7C77AD99BC-658F-4544-B96F-B1249DA48F1C%2F%29).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Consider your docset organization carefully. If you wind up having to re-organize content at a later date, it's important to realize that it is not possible to redirect document id across docsets. The practical result of this is that content that moves from one docset to another will lose all connection to previous BI data and customer feedback as part of the move.
