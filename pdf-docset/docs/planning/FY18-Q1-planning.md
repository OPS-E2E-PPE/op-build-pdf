# FY18 Q1 Planning 

**Planning week dates and location:**<br>Monday - Friday, June 12 - 16, Shanghai

**Attendees:**<br>
Shanghai: Zhen; PMs; dev leads; dev ICs (optional/as appropriate)<br>
Redmond: Dan; Duncan; Arthur; Martin; Megan; Sandra; Adam; Brady; Sudeep; Sandesh

**High-level agenda:**<br>
Based on near-universal feedback from previous planning trips, we aim to reduce the number of meetings during FY18 Q1 planning, and instead focus on:

- Presenting and confirming the high-level roadmap.
- Deep dives on only about *three* top priority areas.
- Reviewing the quarterly backlog.

Additional meetings can be scheduled by individuals during free time, and should only include relevant stakeholders. These meetings will not be managed by the planning team.
