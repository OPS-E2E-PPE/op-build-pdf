# Acrolinx for APEX technical content

Acrolinx is software that provides content authors with automated feedback on grammar, spelling, punctuation, writing style, terminology, and voice. Acrolinx is available both upstream and locally - upstream, users get automatic results from the Acrolinx integration for GitHub, which writes Acrolinx results to each pull request. The tool is seamlessly integrated into the pull request workflow.

Locally, the Acrolinx extension for Visual Studio Code is now available so you can obtain the Acrolinx feedback *before* you push content to the upstream repository.

Currently, Acrolinx is available for use only with content in the following GitHub repositories:

- Microsoft/azure-content-pr
- Azure/azure-docs-cli-python
- Azure/azure-docs-rest-apis
- MicrosoftDocs/sql-docs-pr

There is a cost associated with extending Acrolinx coverage to other APEX-owned content repositories. Expansion is planned for FY18, but is dependent on budget and prioritization. Any expansion to other content sets will occur at the beginning of FY18. Contact [tysonn](mailto:tysonn@microsoft.com) if you have questions about using Acrolinx with your content set.
