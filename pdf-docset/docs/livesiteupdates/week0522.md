Overall https://docs.microsoft.com had **Good availability and Performance** for this week. We haven't achieved 99.9% target for last week, due to some keynote agent failures intermittently which brought down the availability to 99.85%. All other sites also didn't achieve 99.9% this week due to transient issues on multiple areas.
