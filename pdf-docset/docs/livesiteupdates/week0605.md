[Docs site error rate](https://msit.powerbi.com/groups/e610335a-39ac-4ca2-b4dc-58ef168c2b48/dashboards/262443dd-d5f9-4081-bd40-bfc086deac3e) for the week is around 574K, decrease of ~10K from last week. Error rate increase mostly on couple of LSIs on docs due to mooncake deployment and missing images deployment on DHS part. 404s seems okay for last week, hence didn't file any bug to content team.
