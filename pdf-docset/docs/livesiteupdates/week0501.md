This is weekly live site update for content sites and online services in C+E APEX team.

Besides the site reliability analysis, performance trends for Open Publishing Service(OPS) are provided as well. While you receive this update in the email, you can always find the [online version](https://opsdocs.azurewebsites.net/en-us/OPSDocs/livesiteupdates/week0501?branch=master) as well as archived updates there.

Overall https://docs.microsoft.com *didn't* achieve 99.9 last week due to one of the EUS instances going down randomly for which we are getting an RCA from Azure webapp team. On a separate note, there wasn't any major customer impact observed during these intermittent failures, thanks to our automated failover mechanism on rendering side.

Forums, MSDN, Technet & other sites were impacted last week due to LSIs ([986083](https://mseng.visualstudio.com/VSChina/_workitems?id=986083) and [987473](https://mseng.visualstudio.com/VSChina/_workitems?id=987473)) (on 05/01 & 05/02) based on the unexpected traffic from Sogou user-agent and /vstudio URL path requests.

[DevMSFT](https://devmsftprod.azurewebsites.net/) availability decrease is due to the DNS Look up failure from single Keynote agent on 05/05, for which we filed a case with Dynatrace team and they confirmed an issue on that day with this agent. Apart from that, overall this website was all fine in both perf and availability metrics.

There were 5 LSIs ([TFS Query](https://mseng.visualstudio.com/vschina/_workitems?id=ec1a8231-15a0-4d3e-a9f5-a25f9317e29d&_a=query)) for this week with a great decrease compared to last week. Some were initially filed as an LSI, but as part of our process we converted to the ideal work item type (Bug, Feature, Task). On a separate note, the best way to report LSIs is through [sitehelp](http://aka.ms/sitehelp).
