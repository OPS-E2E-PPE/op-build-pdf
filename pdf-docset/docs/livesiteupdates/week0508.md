[Docs site error rate](https://msit.powerbi.com/groups/e610335a-39ac-4ca2-b4dc-58ef168c2b48/dashboards/262443dd-d5f9-4081-bd40-bfc086deac3e) for the week is around 250K, decrease of ~150K from last week. This is a great improvement from reliability perspective and we didn't notice any anamolies on 404 trend too, hence didn't file any LSIs for content teams.
