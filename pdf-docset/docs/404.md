# Customized 404 Page

In case your customer enters a URL which is in the scope of your domain base path, but not referenced by any content you published, they would be redirected to a 404 page. 

In most cases, site would provide a default 404 page. If you'd like to provide your user a better experience, you can create a file 404.md in the root folder of your docset, then OPS will bring user to the 404 page you specified that might contain instructions on what to do next. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Referring to an image by relative path is not supported in customized 404 pages. As workarounds, you can either use absolute URL of the image or [embed the base64-encoded image](http://www.bigfastblog.com/embed-base64-encoded-images-inline-in-html).
