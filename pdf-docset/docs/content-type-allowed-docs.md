# What type of documention do we host in docs.microsoft.com?
We often get the question of what type of documentation should be hosted in docs.microsoft.com. The answer is `public technical documentation only`. Non-publicly available documentation must not be hosted in Docs.com.

## Non-Public aka Private documentation
For the cases where private content needs to be accessible only to Microsoft and/or external partners please use any of the following options:

* Yammer.
* Connect: http://connect.microsoft.com/ 
* Wiki tool, example OSG - https://osgwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page 
* SharePoint
*	Stack Overflow for Q&A
* PDF

## Docs.com for China
China hosting requeres special treatment. We generally host through a 3rd party in China. 

An example:
The URL for Azure China aka Mooncake is www.azure.cn and they use the technology of the company 21V to host Mooncake product/service info and tech documents.

## What about blogs?
Blogs shouldn’t be under a Docs URL (with one exception of the Docs team blog!). Blogs should go under blogs URLs (blogs.msdn), Docs should go under Docs URLs. (docs.). Please contact the right [APEX PM](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/Visual_Studio_China/_layouts/OneNote.aspx?id=%2Fteams%2FVisual_Studio_China%2FShared%20Documents%2FDOCS.MSFT&wd=target%28Overview.one%7CAC65D90B-5DA7-458E-9AA6-D2C98F06E207%2FTeam%7C94DC06FE-C59B-4D69-8BD6-D12060CF2F55%2F%29) for more info.

If you all want to have a 3rd party run it (and have budget), and at your own domain, I’d recommend Automattic (creators of WordPress) have a great solution to outsource this whole thing using their VIP service which includes custom UX, reporting, workflow, 24/7 support, etc. Please contact [Dan Fernandez](mailto:danielfe@microsoft.com) for further information on people using such solution.

## Marketing Pages

Docs does not allow marketing pages, so what is a marketing page? This could be a helpful evaluation question: is the page trying to convince (generally marketing) or to teach (generally technical documentation). If you have something that might fall under the marketing category please contact your APEX onboarding PM for questions. 

## Marketing Requests

Where to host any marketing page? Developer.microsoft.com/yourservice could be used for those purposes, please contact [Mohammad Al-Sabt](mailto:mosabt@microsoft.com) for more information.
